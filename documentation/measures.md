### <kbd>Measure</kbd> Time

of algorithms. Instances of this class have no functionality. 

### <kbd>MeasureCombination</kbd> AM

Combines several measures through their arithmetic mean. 
Instantiates a combination of several measures. More measures with their own weights and threhsolded range 
can be added with the `add(measure, weight=1, min_val=-inf, max_val=inf)` method. 

Args: 
 * *measures:* Optional. An iterable of measures to combine. If None (default) no new measure is added. 
 * *weights:* Optional. A iterable of floats with which to weight the measures provided by the previous argument.
