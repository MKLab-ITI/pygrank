# :scroll: List of Postprocessors
*This file is automatically generated with `docgenerator.py`.*

The following postprocessors can be imported from the package `pygrank.algorithms.postprocess`.
Constructor details are provided, including arguments inherited from and passed to parent classes.
All of them can be used through the code patterns presented at the library's [documentation](documentation.md).  

### Normalize 

Normalizes ranks by dividing with their maximal value. 
Initializes the class with a base ranker instance. Args are automatically filled in and 
re-ordered if at least one is provided. 

Args: 
 * *ranker:* The base ranker instance. A Tautology() ranker is created if None (default) was specified. 
 * *method:* Divide ranks either by their "max" (default) or by their "sum" or make the lie in the "range" [0,1] by subtracting their mean before diving by their max. 

Example:

```python 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms.postprocess import Normalize 
>>> G, seed_values, algorithm = ... 
>>> algorithm = Normalize(0.5, algorithm) # sets ranks >= 0.5 to 1 and lower ones to 0 
>>> ranks = algorithm.rank(G, seed_values) 
```


Example (same outcome, simpler one-liner):

```python 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms.postprocess import Normalize 
>>> G, seed_values, algorithm = ... 
>>> ranks = Normalize(0.5).transform(algorithm.rank(G, seed_values)) 
```


### Ordinals 

Converts ranking outcome to ordinal numbers. 
The highest rank is set to 1, the second highest to 2, etc. 
Initializes the class with a base ranker instance. 

Args: 
 * *ranker:* Optional. The base ranker instance. A Tautology() ranker is created if None (default) was specified. 

### Sweep 

Applies a sweep procedure that divides personalized node ranks by corresponding non-personalized ones. 
Initializes the sweep procedure. 

Args: 
 * *ranker:* The base ranker instance. 
 * *uniform_ranker:* Optional. The ranker instance used to perform non-personalized ranking. If None (default) the base ranker is used. 

### Tautology 

Returns ranks as-are. 
Can be used as a baseline against which to compare other postprocessors. 

### Threshold 

Converts ranking outcome to binary values based on a threshold value. 
Initializes the Threshold postprocessing scheme. Args are automatically filled in and 
re-ordered if at least one is provided. 

Args: 
 * *threshold:* Optional. The minimum numeric value required to output rank 1 instead of 0. If "gap" (default) then its value is automatically determined based on the maximal percentage increase between consecutive ranks. 
 * *ranker:* Optional. The base ranker instance. A Tautology() ranker is created if None (default) was specified. 

Example:

```python 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms.postprocess import Threshold 
>>> G, seed_values, algorithm = ... 
>>> algorithm = Threshold(0.5, algorithm) # sets ranks >= 0.5 to 1 and lower ones to 0 
>>> ranks = algorithm.rank(G, seed_values) 
```


Example (same outcome):

```python 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms.postprocess import Threshold 
>>> G, seed_values, algorithm = ... 
>>> ranks = Threshold(0.5).transform(algorithm.rank(G, seed_values)) 
```
