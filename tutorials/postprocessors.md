# :scroll: List of Postprocessors
*This file is automatically generated with `docgenerator.py`.*

The following postprocessors can be imported from the package `pygrank.algorithms.postprocess`. Constructor details are provided, including arguments inherited from and passed to parent classesAll of them can be used through the code patterns presented at the library's [documentation](documentation.md).  

### Normalize 

Normalizes ranks by dividing with their maximal value. 
Initializes the class with a base ranker instance. Attributes are automatically filled in and 
re-ordered if at least one is provided. 

Attributes: 
 * *ranker:* The base ranker instance. A Tautology() ranker is created if None (default) was specified. 
 * *method:* Divide ranks either by their "max" (default) or by their "sum" 

Example:

``` 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms.postprocess import Threshold 
>>> G, seed_values, algorithm = ... 
>>> algorithm = Threshold(0.5, algorithm) # sets ranks >= 0.5 to 1 and lower ones to 0 
>>> ranks = algorithm.rank(G, seed_values) 
```


Example (same outcome, quicker one-time use):

``` 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms.postprocess import Normalize 
>>> G, seed_values, algorithm = ... 
>>> ranks = Normalize(0.5).transform(algorithm.rank(G, seed_values)) 
```


### Ordinals 

Converts ranking outcome to ordinal numbers. 
The highest rank is set to 1, the second highest to 2, etc. 
Initializes the class with a base ranker instance. 

Attributes: 
 * *ranker:* Optional. The base ranker instance. A Tautology() ranker is created if None (default) was specified. 

### Threshold 

Converts ranking outcome to binary values based on a threshold value. 
Initializes the Threshold postprocessing scheme. Attributes are automatically filled in and 
re-ordered if at least one is provided. 

Attributes: 
 * *threshold:* Optional. The minimum numeric value required to output rank 1 instead of 0. If "gap" (default) then its value is automatically determined based on the maximal percentage increase between consecutive ranks. 
 * *ranker:* Optional. The base ranker instance. A Tautology() ranker is created if None (default) was specified. 

Example:

``` 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms.postprocess import Threshold 
>>> G, seed_values, algorithm = ... 
>>> algorithm = Threshold(0.5, algorithm) # sets ranks >= 0.5 to 1 and lower ones to 0 
>>> ranks = algorithm.rank(G, seed_values) 
```


Example (same outcome):

``` 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms.postprocess import Threshold 
>>> G, seed_values, algorithm = ... 
>>> ranks = Threshold(0.5).transform(algorithm.rank(G, seed_values)) 
```
