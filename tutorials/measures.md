# :scroll: List of Measures
*This file is automatically generated with `docgenerator.py`.*

The following measures can be imported from the package `pygrank.measures`.
Constructor details are provided, including arguments inherited from and passed to parent classes.
All of them can be used through the code patterns presented at the library's [documentation](documentation.md).  

### AM 
 

### AMtarget 
 

### AUC 

Wrapper for sklearn.metrics.auc evaluation. 
Initializes the supervised measure with desired graph signal outcomes. 

Args: 
 * *known_ranks:* The desired graph signal outcomes. 

### Accuracy 
 
Initializes the supervised measure with desired graph signal outcomes. 

Args: 
 * *known_ranks:* The desired graph signal outcomes. 

### Conductance 

Graph conductance (information flow) of ranks. 
Assumes a fuzzy set of subgraphs whose nodes are included with probability proportional to their ranks, 
as per the formulation of [krasanakis2019linkauc] and calculates E[outgoing edges] / E[internal edges] of 
the fuzzy rank subgraph. 
If ranks assume binary values, E[.] becomes set size and this calculates the induced subgraph Conductance. 
Initializes the Conductance metric. 

Attributes: 
 * *G:* The graph on which to calculate the metric. 
 * *max_rank:* Optional. The maximum value ranks can assume. To maintain a probabilistic formulation of conductance, this can be greater but not less than the maximum rank during evaluation. Default is 1. 

Example:

```python 
>>> from pygrank.metrics.unsupervised import Conductance 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms.postprocess import Normalize 
>>> G, seed_nodes, algorithm = ... 
>>> algorithm = Normalize(algorithm) 
>>> ranks = algorithm.rank(G, seed_nodes) 
>>> conductance = Conductance(G).evaluate(ranks) 
```


### CrossEntropy 

Computes a cross-entropy loss of ranks vs known ranks. 
Initializes the supervised measure with desired graph signal outcomes. 

Args: 
 * *known_ranks:* The desired graph signal outcomes. 

### Density 

Extension of graph density that can account for ranks. 
Assumes a fuzzy set of subgraphs whose nodes are included with probability proportional to their ranks, 
as per the formulation of [krasanakis2019linkauc] and calculates E[internal edges] / E[possible edges] of 
the fuzzy rank subgraph. 
If ranks assume binary values, E[.] becomes set size and this calculates the induced subgraph Density. 
Initializes the Density metric. 

Attributes: 
 * *G:* The graph on which to calculate the metric. 

Example:

```python 
>>> from pygrank.metrics.unsupervised import Density 
>>> G, seed_nodes, algorithm = ... 
>>> ranks = algorithm.rank(G, seed_nodes) 
>>> conductance = Density(G).evaluate(ranks) 
```


### Error 

Computes the mean absolute error between ranks and known ranks. 
Initializes the supervised measure with desired graph signal outcomes. 

Args: 
 * *known_ranks:* The desired graph signal outcomes. 

### GM 
 

### KLDivergence 

Computes KL-divergence of ranks vs known ranks. 
Initializes the supervised measure with desired graph signal outcomes. 

Args: 
 * *known_ranks:* The desired graph signal outcomes. 

### Mean 
 

### Modularity 
 

### NDCG 

Provides evaluation of NDCG@k score between given and known ranks. 
Initializes the PageRank scheme parameters. 

Attributes: 
 * *k:* Optional. Calculates NDCG@k. If None (default), len(known_ranks) is used. 
 * *known_ranks:* The desired graph signal outcomes. 

### pRule 

Provides an assessment of stochastic ranking fairness. 
Initializes the supervised measure with desired graph signal outcomes. 

Args: 
 * *known_ranks:* The desired graph signal outcomes.
