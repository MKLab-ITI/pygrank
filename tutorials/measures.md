### <kbd>MeasureCombination</kbd> AM

Combines several measures through their arithmetic mean. 
Instantiates a combination of several measures. More measures with their own weights and threhsolded range 
can be added with the `add(measure, weight=1, min_val=-inf, max_val=inf)` method. 

Args: 
 * *measures:* Optional. An iterable of measures to combine. If None (default) no new measure is added. 
 * *weights:* Optional. A iterable of floats with which to weight the measures provided by the previous argument. The concept of weighting depends on how measures are aggregated, but it corresponds to an importance value placed on each measure. If None (default), provided measures are all weighted by 1. 
 * *thresholds:* Optional. A tuple of [min_val, max_val] with which to bound measure outcomes. If None (default) provided measures

### <kbd>Unsupervised</kbd> Conductance

Graph conductance (information flow) of ranks. 
Assumes a fuzzy set of subgraphs whose nodes are included with probability proportional to their ranks,

Args: 
 * *graph:* Optional. The graph on which to calculate the metric. If None (default) it is automatically extracted from graph signals passed for evaluation.

Example:

>>> from pygrank.metrics.unsupervised import Conductance 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms.postprocess import Normalize
