# :scroll: List of Graph Filters
*This file is automatically generated with `docgenerator.py`.*

The following filters can be imported from the package `pygrank.algorithms`.
Constructor details are provided, including arguments inherited from and passed to parent classes.
All of them can be used through the code patterns presented at the library's [documentation](documentation.md). 

### AbsorbingRank 

Implementation of partial absorbing random walks for Lambda = diag(absorbtion vector), e.g. Lambda = aI 
Wu, Xiao-Ming, et al. "Learning with partially absorbing random walks." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2012. 
Initializes the AbsorbingRank filter parameters. 

Args: 
 * *alpha:* Optional. (1-alpha)/alpha is the absorbtion rate of the random walk. This is chosen to yield the same underlying meaning as PageRank (for which Lambda = a Diag(degrees) ) 
 * *use_quotient:* Optional. If True (default) performs a L1 re-normalization of ranks after each iteration. This significantly speeds up the convergence speed of symmetric normalization (col normalization preserves the L1 norm during computations on its own). Can also pass Postprocessor instances to adjust node scores after each iteration with the Postprocessor.transform(ranks) method. Can pass False or None to ignore this parameter's functionality. 
 * *to_scipy:* Optional. Method to extract a scipy sparse matrix from a networkx graph. If None (default), pygrank.algorithms.utils.preprocessor is used with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 
 * *convergence:* Optional. The ConvergenceManager that determines when iterations stop. If None (default), a ConvergenceManager with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 

Example:

```python 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms import adhoc 
>>> algorithm = adhoc.HeatKernel(t=5, tol=1.E-9) # tol passed to the ConvergenceManager 
```


### GenericGraphFilter 

Implements a graph filter with a specific vector of weight parameters. 
Initializes the graph filter. 

Args: 
 * *weights:* A list-like object with elements weights[n] proportional to the importance of propagating personalization graph signals n hops away. Default is [0.9]*10 . 
 * *to_scipy:* Optional. Method to extract a scipy sparse matrix from a networkx graph. If None (default), pygrank.algorithms.utils.preprocessor is used with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 
 * *convergence:* Optional. The ConvergenceManager that determines when iterations stop. If None (default), a ConvergenceManager with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 

### HeatKernel 

Heat kernel filter. 
Initializes the HearKernel filter parameters. 

Args: 
 * *t:* Optional. How many hops until the importance of new nodes starts decreasing. Default value is 5. 
 * *to_scipy:* Optional. Method to extract a scipy sparse matrix from a networkx graph. If None (default), pygrank.algorithms.utils.preprocessor is used with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 
 * *convergence:* Optional. The ConvergenceManager that determines when iterations stop. If None (default), a ConvergenceManager with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 

Example:

```python 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms import adhoc 
>>> algorithm = adhoc.HeatKernel(t=5, tol=1.E-9) # tol passed to the ConvergenceManager 
```


### PageRank 

A Personalized PageRank power method algorithm. 
Initializes the PageRank scheme parameters. 

Args: 
 * *alpha:* Optional. 1-alpha is the bias towards the personalization. Default value is 0.85. 
 * *use_quotient:* Optional. If True (default) performs a L1 re-normalization of ranks after each iteration. This significantly speeds up the convergence speed of symmetric normalization (col normalization preserves the L1 norm during computations on its own). Can also pass Postprocessor instances to adjust node scores after each iteration with the Postprocessor.transform(ranks) method. Can pass False or None to ignore this parameter's functionality. 
 * *to_scipy:* Optional. Method to extract a scipy sparse matrix from a networkx graph. If None (default), pygrank.algorithms.utils.preprocessor is used with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 
 * *convergence:* Optional. The ConvergenceManager that determines when iterations stop. If None (default), a ConvergenceManager with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 

Example:

```python 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms import adhoc 
>>> algorithm = adhoc.PageRank(alpha=0.99, tol=1.E-9) # tol passed to the ConvergenceManager 
```
