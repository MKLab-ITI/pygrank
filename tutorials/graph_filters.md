# :scroll: List of Graph Filters
*This file is automatically generated with `docgenerator.py`.*

The following filters can be imported from the package `pygrank.algorithms`. Constructor details are provided, including arguments inherited from and passed to parent classes.All of them can be used through the code patterns presented at the library's [documentation](documentation.md).  

### HeatKernel 

Heat kernel filter. 
Initializes the HearKernel filter parameters. 

Args: 
 * *t:* Optional. How many hops until the importance of new nodes starts decreasing. Default value is 5. 
 * *to_scipy:* Optional. Method to extract a scipy sparse matrix from a networkx graph. If None (default), pygrank.algorithms.utils.preprocessor is used with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 
 * *convergence:* Optional. The ConvergenceManager that determines when iterations stop. If None (default), a ConvergenceManager with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 

Example:

```python 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms import pagerank 
>>> algorithm = pagerank.HeatKernel(t=5, tol=1.E-9) # tol passed to the ConvergenceManager 
```


### PageRank 

A Personalized PageRank power method algorithm. 
Initializes the PageRank scheme parameters. 

Args: 
 * *alpha:* Optional. 1-alpha is the bias towards the personalization. Default value is 0.85. 
 * *use_quotient:* Optional. If True (default) performs a L1 re-normalization of ranks after each iteration. This significantly speeds ups the convergence speed of symmetric normalization (col normalization preserves the L1 norm during computations on its own). Can also pass a pygrank.algorithm.postprocess filter to perform any kind of normalization through its postprocess method. Note that these can slow down computations due to needing to convert ranks between skipy and maps after each iteration. Can pass False or None to ignore this parameter's functionality. 
 * *to_scipy:* Optional. Method to extract a scipy sparse matrix from a networkx graph. If None (default), pygrank.algorithms.utils.preprocessor is used with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 
 * *convergence:* Optional. The ConvergenceManager that determines when iterations stop. If None (default), a ConvergenceManager with keyword arguments automatically extracted from the ones passed to this constructor. 

Example:

```python 
>>> from pygrank.algorithms import pagerank 
>>> algorithm = pagerank.PageRank(alpha=0.99, tol=1.E-9) # tol passed to the ConvergenceManager 
```
